I have also been assigned to projects that use third party applications, SDKs, or require queries from a mainframe. I'm currently considering to do projects to expand this portfolio, be it \"simple\" things that can provide some utility or are able to deepen my knowledge. I am also willing to receive \"quick\" jobs such as application development, consulting or software development for thesis. My hobbies range from anything related to technology, books, philosophy or religion. I am always willing to learn new things.";
